Hardware and Software environment
This example requires :

a 3D printer board STEVAL-3DP001V1
a 3D printer mechanic
How to load the FW?
A binary of the FW can be found under folder: \stm32_cube\Binary. To load it or to load your own binary into the 3D printer board, the easiest way is to use the mass storage interface provided by the embedded ST-LINK (simply drag and drop to disk). To use it, follow the procedure below:

Power on the 3D Printer board by connecting its connectors Vin (12V-24V) and Gnd to a DC power supply
Connect the ST 3D Printer reference board to a PC with the USB cable through the ST Link USB port. Jumper J22 (boot mode selection) must be set.
In your files explorer, a new drive should appear in the list of removable storages. If this is not the case, this is probably because you haven't the ST-Link USB driver. You can find it here.
Just copy, the binary file to the root of this new drive. Then refresh your file explorer: if the binary file has disappeared and no error log file has been generated, it means the binary file has been successfully loaded.
Reset the board to start the loaded binary file. To correctly start the default firmware requires a SD card with a configuration file.
How to build the FW?
In order to recompile the program , you must do the following :

Open OpenSTM32 (SW4STM32) toolchain (you can download installer for your OS here. You shall be register to download it for free
the workspace location must be stm32_cube/STM32/Projects/SW4STM32
then In ProjectExplorer, import an existing project into workspace : stm32_cube/STM32/Projects/SW4STM32/Marlin_3DPrinter/
Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
